# My Favorite List
This application has the objective to list items from two distinct APIs sources.

The chosen apis are: 
- [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#quick-start)
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com)

# Configurations
- Postgres
- yarn
- node (version used is 16.5.0

# Frontend
Start going to the folder “frontend” and install the libraries with the command “yarn” or “npm install --force”.

## Backend baseurl
This explanation is only for the ones that are not running the backend on localhost.
If you are not running the backend on localhost you need to change the file “src/services/api.ts”. On this file change the value of baseURL to fit your case.

## Start Frontend
To start the frontend you can run the command “yarn start” or “npm run start”.
